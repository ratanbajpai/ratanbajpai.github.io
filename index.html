      <h1>Per capita GDP and working hours in OECD countries.</h1>

      <p>This presentation attempts to find any correlation between the number of annual
        hours worked per worker and the per capita GDP in OECD countries. The Organiation
        for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) is an inter-governmental organisation
        formed in 1961. It's purpose is to stimulate economic progress and world trade. Although
        the countries listed in this dataset are spread out across all the continents, there
        are only two countries from Africa and none from the Middle Eastern region. In terms of
        economic prosperity, the data is well represented by rich and poor countries. This
        visualisation can attempt to answer questions like:
        "Do people in rich countries work longer hours?"
      </p>

      <h2>Data Source</h2>
      <p>
        The source for data used in this visualisation is from:
        <a href="https://www.rug.nl/ggdc/productivity/pwt/">
                Groningen Growth and Development Center</a>)
        This is a large dataset with several fields for various economic and developmental
        parameters. The total dataset spans almost last 70 years. However, data related to
        number of annual hours worked is somewhat limited. This specific information is not
        available for a group of countries prior to 1990s.
      </p>

      <h2>Visualization</h2>
      
        <p>This <b>Interactive Slideshow</b> visualisation allows the user to step through the three available years
          while providing the ability to explore the data at each time point.
          The visualisation also provides some annotations detailing some interesting findings within the data.
        </p>

        <br>

        <p>It can be seen from the interactive slideshow that the various regions of the world have widely differing
          trends towards urbanisation. Some regions are currently quite rural (for example Sub-Saharan Africa)
          with a significant trend towards urbanisation while other regions are already highly urbanised (for
          example Middle East & North Africa), possibly due to lack of space or habitable space and are continuing
          that trend.
