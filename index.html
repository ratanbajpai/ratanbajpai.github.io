      <h1>Relation Between Per Capita GDP and Working Hours in OECD Countries</h1>

      <p>This presentation attempts to find any correlation between the number of annual
        hours worked per worker and the per capita GDP in OECD countries. The Organiation
        for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) is an inter-governmental organisation
        formed in 1961. It's purpose is to stimulate economic progress and world trade. Although
        the countries listed in this dataset are spread out across all the continents, there
        is very little representation from Africa and the Middle Eastern region. In terms of
        economic prosperity, the data is well represented by rich and poor countries. This
        visualisation can attempt to answer questions like:
        <i>"Do people in rich countries work longer hours?"</i>
      </p>

      <h2>Data Set</h2>
      <p>
        The source for data used in this visualisation is from:
        <a href="https://www.rug.nl/ggdc/productivity/pwt/">
          Groningen Growth and Development Center</a>.
          This is a large dataset with several fields for various economic and developmental
          indicators. The total dataset spans almost last 70 years. However, data related to
          number of annual hours worked is somewhat limited. This specific information is not
          available for a group of countries prior to 1990s. The latest total data available is till
          the year 2019.
        </p>

        <h2>Visualization</h2>
        <p>The data in this visualisation is presented as interactive bubble plot, with per
          capita GDP on X-axis, whereas the average annual hours per worker on Y-axis. The
          size of the bubbles is proportional to the population of the countries shown.
          The per capita GDP is represented in 2017 US$. The population information is rounded
          to the nearest million. The data is depicted as a slide show, where each slide
          shows data for a particular year. The three years chosen are almost 20 years apart
          each. This choice clearly shows how the working hours and per capita GDP has changed
          for several countries. More information is available when the cursor is moved to a
          specific country.

        <h2>Observations</h2>
        <p>The trend that can be noticed from this visualisation is that as decades
          have passed, the per capita GDP has obviously increased, but the number
          of annual working hours per worker has declined for almost all of the
          countries barring a few. This can be attributed to the fact that
          industrialization and automation have increased worker productivity. It
          can also be noticed that for developed economies (higher per capita GDP) in
          Europe and North America, the working hours are markedly less than the poorer
          and developing economies of the Asian countries. There are a couple exceptions
          to this as in the case of Singapore. Even though it has high per capita GDP,
          it's workers on average tend to work longer hours. Another interesting
          observation is that in the last two decades, Ireland has been able to grow
          it's per capita GDP substantially while also bringing down the number of
          hours worked by it's workers.
        </p>

        <h2>Conclusions</h2>
        <p> From this visualization, it's easy to see that economic prosperity across
          the world is greatly unequal. In highly developed nations in Europe and North
          America, people tend to work a lot less hours with respect to some of the poorer
          nations in the Asian subcontinent. People in Ireland or Switzerland
          which are one of the wealthiest nations today, have an average income that is
          more than 20 times than that of people in Cambodia or Myanmar. However, an average
          worker in Cambodia puts in 900 more hours a year than an average worker in Switzerland.
          This can be attributed to the fact that these developed nations have been able to
          leverage technology and automation to drive up productivity and per capita GDP
          substantially. It's quite clear from the data that workers in poorer countries
          work much more in some cases than their rich counterparts.
